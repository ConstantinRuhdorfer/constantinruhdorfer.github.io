I have joined the International Max Plank Research School on Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS) and the Human Computer Interaction and Cognitive Systems (HCI CS) group at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, as a  Ph.D. scholar. 
My work will focus on improving human-AI cooperation by investigating the intersection of Machine Theory of Mind and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
