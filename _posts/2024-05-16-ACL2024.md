title: Paper Accepted at ACL 2024
---

I am very happy to announce that we have a paper accepted at [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org) in the main conference.
The paper is titled [Limits of Theory of Mind Modelling in Dialogue-Based Collaborative Plan Acquisition](https://www.perceptualui.org/publications/bortoletto24_acl.pdf) and explores a recent issue in Theory of Mind modelling in which deep learning models learn to take shortcuts instead of modeling mental states correctly:

Bortoletto, M., Ruhdorfer, C., Abdessaied, A., Shi, L. & Bulling, A. (2024).
*Limits of Theory of Mind Modelling in Dialogue-Based Collaborative Plan Acquisition* 
Proc. 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pp. 1â€“16.

This is a great success and I want to espescially congratulate the first author, [Matteo](https://mattbortoletto.github.io), for his incredible work!
Thanks to all my co-authors!
