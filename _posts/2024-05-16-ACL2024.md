title: Paper Accepted at ACL 2024
---

I am very happy to announce that we have a paper accepted at [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org) in the main conference.
The paper is titled [Limits of Theory of Mind Modelling in Dialogue-Based Collaborative Plan Acquisition]() and explores a recent issue in Theory of Mind modelling in which deep learning models learn to take shortcuts instead of modeling mental stats correctly:

Proc. of the Proceedings of the 62th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

This is a great success and I want to espescially congratulate the first author, [Matteo](https://mattbortoletto.github.io), for his incredible work!
Thanks to all my co-authors!
