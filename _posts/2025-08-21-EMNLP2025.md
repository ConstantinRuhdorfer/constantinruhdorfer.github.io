title: Two papers accepted at EMNLP 2025
---

I am very happy to announce that we have two papers accepted at EMNLP 2025! 
Both works deal with Theory of Mind and Large Language Models.
In the first we study how LLMs represent beliefs (findings) and in the second we propose a new benchmark for evaluating the Theory of Mind abilities of LLMs (main conference).
