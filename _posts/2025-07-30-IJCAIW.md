title: Paper Accepted at ToM IJCAI 2025
---

I am very happy to announce that we have a paper accepted at [ToM IJCAI 2025](https://tomworkshop.github.io).
Our work will be featured as a **long oral talk** at the workshop.
The paper is titled [The Y≈çkai Learning Environment: Tracking Beliefs Over Space and Time](https://collaborative-ai.org/publications/ruhdorfer25_ijcaiw/) and proposes a new multi-agent RL environment for zero-shot coordination and Theory of Mind research.
