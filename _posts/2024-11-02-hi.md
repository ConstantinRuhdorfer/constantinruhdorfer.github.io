Hi, I am a Ph.D. scholar at International Max Plank Research School on Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS) and the Human Computer Interaction and Cognitive Systems (HCI CS) group at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. I work to improve human-AI cooperation by investigating the intersection of Machine Theory of Mind and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
