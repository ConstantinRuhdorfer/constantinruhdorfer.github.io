title: New Practical Course: Computational Theory of Mind and Cognition
---

[Matteo Bortoletto](https://mattbortoletto.github.io), [Anna Penzkofer](https://apenzko.github.io) and I are organizing a practical course on [Computational Theory of Mind and Cognition](https://campus.uni-stuttgart.de/cusonline/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/pl/ui/$ctx/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?$ctx=design=ca2;header=max;lang=en&pStpSpNr=391032) for master students in computing fields at the University of Stuttgart.
The goal of this course is to familiarise students with exciting current research topics at the intersection of machine learning, computational cognitive modelling, and human-computer interaction.
We place a special emphasis on modelling core processes of human cognition in computing systems, i.e. we place an emphasis on Machine Theory of Mind.
Techniques used by students in their projects include Multi-Modal Deep Learning, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and biologically plausible learning methods like Spiking Neural Networks.
The course is an advanced master-level one that requires previous experience with deep learning and related fields to enable students to engange with ongoing research in the field of computational human modelling.
