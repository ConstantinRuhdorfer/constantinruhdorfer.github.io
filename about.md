Hi, I am a Ph.D. scholar at International Max Plank Research School on Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS) and the Human Computer Interaction and Cognitive Systems (HCI CS) group at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. 
I work to improve human-AI cooperation by investigating the intersection of Machine Theory of Mind and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

You can find more about my work [here](https://www.perceptualui.org/people/ruhdorfer/) or find me on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=Bb4aplwAAAAJ&hl=de).

I obtained my masters degree in Informatics at the University of Stuttgart (with distinction). 
Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree (with distinction) in Informatics at the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (also known as Duale Hochschule Baden-Wuerttemberg (DHBW) in german) in cooperation with diconium digital solutions GmbH where I worked in various departements as a software developer/student researcher.

I my free time you will either find me coocking or likely bouldering.
